0,What exactly will I own after I purchase CashBet Coin? How can I use it?,"You will own CashBet Coin. CashBet Coin may be used in the following ways: White label platform partners will be encouraged, in the form rate reductions, to use CBC to pay licensing and maintenance fees to CashBet. CBC  may be used by other iGaming operators (social or real-money) as a deposit, payment, and withdrawal mechanism. In this way, CBC has a similar (but enhanced) utility to any other payment mechanism. Content distribution partners will likewise be incentivized (in the form of lower rates) to use CBC to pay licensing fees to CashBet.  Casinos incorporating games from CryptoRGS will be required to offer deposit and wagering in CBC. CBC tokens may be granted to players as a reward for referring friends. Players who hold a certain number of eligible CBC tokens will be offered CBC VIP status in exchange for executing a time-locked contract, sequestering the tokens in the players’ wallet so that they may neither be spent nor otherwise traded. This VIP management feature will be licensed to other operators who may accept CBC for purchase or deposit, allowing them to manage their own CBC-based VIP programs. Please note: the use and of CashBet Coin on the CashBet platform is subject to the separate terms and conditions, and may vary depending on a person’s place of residence, where they access the platform and/or other factors. A number of jurisdictions do not allow, or restrict, real money gambling / wagering – see our Terms at https://coin.cashbet.com/terms for a full list of our current restricted jurisdictions. CashBet prevents players from accessing its platforms in these restricted jurisdictions by verifying player geolocation, blocking internet protocol (IP) addresses from restricted jurisdictions, and undertaking due diligence (which includes place of residence). Residents and persons in these countries may not gamble on the platform – they may only use CBC to participate in non-gambling activities."
